# `quick_access_cmds` represents the keyboard that will be displayed as Telegram keyboard (for quick
# access to frequently used commands).
#
# It is an array of arrays of strings. Second-level arrays represent lines of keyboard (top-to-bottom),
# strings in them are the commands for the keyboard.
#
# `quick_access_cmds` can be empty (or completely omitted in the config), but its subarrays and the strings
# in them must not be empty.
#
# After you update `quick_access_cmds` in the config, you should restart the bot (so that the config file
# is reread) and then send `/start` command in Telegram (so that the keyboard on your Telegram client
# is updated)

# `emergency_shutdown_command` is a string that can be used for emergency shutdown, intended for
# the scenario when a malicious user gets access to one of the admins' accounts.
# If the bot receives a message with this text, it terminates immediately. Notice, that the message
# text must exactly match the string (including lowercase/capital letters and special symbols),
# except for the leading and trailing whitespaces (they will be ignored).
#
# For example, if the command is set to '/A b123C ', message ' /A b123C' will terminate the bot,
# while 'A b123C', '/A b123c', or '/Ab123C' won't.

# If `emergency_shutdown_public` is `True`, then **any user**, not just the admins, will be allowed
# to use the `emergency_shutdown_command`. It is useful in case you loose access to your admin account
# while the intruder is still there: with this enabled you will be able to terminate the bot from any
# other account.
#
# It is recommended to leave this enabled and keep the emergency shutdown command in secret.
